# Pathfinding
A simulation made in Unity visualising A* pathfinding algorithm.

The agent utilizes a FSM and A* pathfinding to collect stars, take them to the merchant, and rest at the ship.
The user can place or remove blockades in real-time by clicking on tiles to test out the pathfinding algorithm.
